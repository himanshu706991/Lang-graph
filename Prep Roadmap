Great — I now fully understand your requirement, and it's a strong use case that showcases your expertise in agentic AI with LangGraph. You're essentially building an end-to-end multi-agent AI pipeline where a query is intelligently routed to:

SQL agent → runs SQL queries from a database and returns a human-readable document response.

PDF agent → searches from vectorized documents (RAG).

OCR/Image agent → reads and retrieves answers from image-based flowcharts or diagrams using OCR + vector DB.

Critic agent → validates and optionally refines the result via human feedback loop.

You're asking for:

End-to-end code for each agent.

Dummy data generation: SQL tables, PDF files per business domain, images/diagrams.

Vector DB setup for PDF and image agents.

Query classification logic (router).

LangGraph implementation showing state transitions.

Containerized deployment: Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml.

Optional UI (Streamlit or FastAPI).

README + Architecture Diagram to explain the solution.

✅ I will now build this entire solution for you step-by-step.
Here’s the plan I’ll follow:

✅ Step 1: Dummy Data Setup
Create fake SQL tables (property, casualty, bank, auto, tech).

Generate PDF files (1 per line of business).

Create flow diagrams (PNG/JPG) and apply OCR-ready text.

✅ Step 2: Vector DB Creation
Chunk and embed PDF files using OpenAI + FAISS or Chroma.

Apply OCR on images and store text embeddings in another vector DB.

✅ Step 3: Agent Definitions
Router Agent: Uses classification logic (prompt-based or fine-tuned).

SQL Agent: Converts natural language to SQL, queries DB, formats result.

PDF Agent: Retrieves relevant chunk via vector DB and formats answer.

Image Agent: OCR → vector search → response generation.

Critic Agent: Uses GPT-based feedback loop or asks user for feedback.

✅ Step 4: LangGraph Workflow
Define state nodes and transitions between agents.

✅ Step 5: Output Formatter
Return final answer as a well-formatted paragraph for presentation.

✅ Step 6: Dockerize the Code
Add Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

✅ Step 7: Optional Streamlit UI
Simple query box + response + flow visualization.

✅ Step 8: Documentation
Add README.md and architecture diagram.
